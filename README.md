# catharsis
**ca·thar·sis** - *the process of releasing, and thereby providing relief from, strong or repressed emotions.*

This website consists of a music player, playlist, and gallery. Its intent is to express myself through another medium that connects music and photography.

The web application itself is completely dynamic and works on both mobile and desktop.

Catharsis is an ongoing project.
